Motivation:
A major cause of public health problems is chronic illness. Data analytics offers a priceless chance to dig deeper into the complex topic matter. 

With a background in Nursing, I've always wondered why so many people suffer from one chronic disease or another. I'm driven to use data analytics to tackle this issue. My aim is to prevent chronic diseases in the future or at least slow their progression.

Questions:
•	What are the trends in chronic disease prevalence rate over the past years, categorized by state?

•	How do behavioral habits vary between genders in relation to obesity?  (physical activity, consuming fruits, and vegetables)


•	Is there a correlation between chronic disease prevalence and obesity rates?

•	How do chronic disease prevalence rates vary across different demographic groups?   

Problems and Hurdles:
In the chronic Diseases dataset, the data values were presented horizontally across rows instead of being organized in a columnar format. This can indeed make it challenging to work with and analyze the data efficiently.
Technologies Used:
1.	Python / Pandas / SQLAlchemy - for exploration, cleaning, and aggregation of the dataset
2.	Tableau - for creating dashboard
3.	PowerPoint - for introduction of Project
4.	Git - for version control
Data Sources:
I utilized the following sources to gather datasets for my analysis :
